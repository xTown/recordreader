They eschew the popular--though; incomplete--narrative focusing on the 1960s and 1970s, and; trace the world-changing social movement to the 1920s. This; broader canvas allows for the struggles of all women, including; working-class women, to come to the foreground. Among the many; myths the book dispels is the notion that feminism was a; movement of the largely white, highly educated, upper middle; class. The authors vividly render the struggles of those women; who organized rallies, demonstrations, and sit-ins--often; working alongside civil rights demonstrators--to demand equal; wages and better jobs, as well as the right to both sexual; pleasure and reproductive control. The book also provides a; counterpoint to the contemporary corporate-backed ""lean-in""; philosophy; the authors argue that this assumes that gains for; a tiny elite will help all women. They demonstrate that, to the; contrary, the gains women have made were created by working; together for social change rather than by striving individually; for personal success. While each new generation since 1920 has; arrived in a world improved by the efforts of previous; struggles, the movement is far from over. Progress is not a; birthright but rather a vision that has been constructed,; reconstructed, and fought for over and over again."" --; Publisher information.; More than sex equality : feminism after suffrage / Dorothy Sue; Cobble -- The Women's Liberation Movement / Linda Gordon --; From a mindset to a movement : feminism since 1990 / Astrid; Henry.","","xxi, 265 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm.","","Gordon, Linda, author.; Henry, Astrid, 1966- author."
