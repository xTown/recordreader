               that God is leading them to the New World, these devout 
               Pilgrims bravely cross the Atlantic. But after violent storms 
               carry them far north of Hudson's River, they fight icy New 
               England winds to build crude shelters. When half die of 
               starvation and cold that winter, the weakened survivors have 
               little hope of facing the specter of Indian attack.

               Puri, India's Most Private Investigator, master of disguise and

               is a supernatural occurrence, and proving who really killed Dr.
               Suresh Jha will require all the detective's earthly faculties. 
               To get at the truth, he and his team of undercover operatives 
               travel from the slum where India's hereditary magicians must be
               persuaded to reveal their secrets to the holy city of Haridwar

NOTE         "On a trip around the world, everyday feels like Saturday. A Map 
               for Saturday reveals a world of long-term, solo travel through 
               the stories of trekkers in 20 countries on four continents. The
               documentary finds backpackers helping neglected Thai tsunami 
               victims. It explains why Nepal's guesthouses are empty and 
               Brazil's stoplights are ignored. But at its core, Saturday 
               tracks the emotional arc of extrlong-term travelers; teenagers 
               and senior citizens who wondered, "What would it be like to 
               travel the world?" Then did it. - from back cover.

               dark. Mozart's final operatic legacy is a great work of the

NOTE         "In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted 
               territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring 
               power of the four classical elements-- fire, water, air, and 
               earth-- to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things 
               to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of 
               culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook 
               with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to 
               beer. In the course of his journey, he discovers that the cook 
               occupies a special place in the world, standing squarely 
               between nature and culture. Both realms are transformed by 
               cooking, and so, in the process, is the cook"--Container.

NOTE         It's 'veggie-mania' in Wallace and Gromit's neighborhood. The two
               enterprising friends are cashing in with their humane pest-
               control outfit, "Anti-Pesto." With only days to go before the 
               annual Giant Vegetable Competition they find that their 
               business is booming. They come to find out that running a 
               "humane" pest control outfit can have its drawbacks. Suddenly, 
               a large and mysterious veg-ravaging "beast" begins attacking 
               the town's sacred vegetable plots at night. The competition 
               hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch the 
               beast and save the day. But Victor Quartermaine would rather 
               shoot the beast and secure the position of local hero - not to 
               mention Lady Tottingon's hand in marriage.

               playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of 
               varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly 
               contradictory, answers to the same questions.

               Fletch is in disguise as a bum, living at the beach, 
               researching drugs and their dealing. One day, Fletch is 
               addressed by Alan Stanwyk, a rich man, who asks him, the bum, a
               favour. For the sum of $50,000, Fletch should kill poor cancer-

               insurance money. What the guy didn't think of was Fletch's real
               profession. Returning into normal life, Fletch instantly takes 
               up research not only to find out that Mr. Stanwyk is healthy as
               life itself but he also runs into certain connections between

DESCRIPT     xi, 211 pages : color illustrations ; 26 cm.
NOTE         "The end-all-be-all guide to ramen from Ivan Orkin, the 
               iconoclastic New York-born owner of Tokyo's top ramen shop. 
               While scores of people line up outside American ramen 
               powerhouses like Momofuku Noodle Bar, chefs and food writers in
               the know revere Ivan Orkin's traditional Japanese take on
               ramen. Ivan Ramen chronicles Orkin's journey from dyed-in-the-
               wool New Yorker to the chef and owner of one of Japan's most-
               loved ramen restaurants, Ivan Ramen. His passion for ramen is 
               contagious, his story fascinating, and his recipes to-die-for, 
               including master recipes for the fundamental types of ramen, 
               and variations on each. Likely the only chef in the world with 
               the knowledge and access to convey such a candid look at 
               Japanese cuisine to a Western audience, Orkin is perfectly 
               positioned to author what will be the ultimate English-language
               overview on ramen and all of its components"-- Provided by

NOTE         "A collection of more than 100 recipes that introduces Japanese 
               comfort food to American home cooks, exploring new ingredients,
               techniques, and the surprising origins of popular dishes like 
               gyoza and tempura. Japanese food is often thought of as
               precise, austere, and time-consuming. But along with the high 
               (kaiseki and tea ceremony) there is also the low (food carts 
               and fried chicken). Through recipes, fascinating narrative, and
               lush location photography, Tadashi Ono and Harris Salat explore
               Japan's long history of homey fare, which has now firmly taken 
               root in the US. Some of the dishes are already loved here, like
               ramen, soba, tempura, and gyoza, but others, like Japanese-
               style fried chicken, rice bowls and okonomiyaki, and savory 
               pancakes, will be deliciously delightful surprises, perfect for
               a weeknight meal or weekend entertaining"-- Provided by

NOTE         Emboldened by the return of Lord Voldemort, the Death Eaters are

               Hogwarts, once thought to be a safe haven, may no longer be 
               safe. Harry suspects that new dangers may lie within the
               castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for 
               the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Harry will

               manipulates his old colleague into returning to his previous

               representatives from three different wizarding schools compete 
               in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, 
               Voldemort's Death Eaters are gaining strength and create the 
               Dark Mark - giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise
               again. In the unsuspecting lives of the students at Hogwarts, 
               the competitors are selected by the goblet of fire, which this 
               year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have 
               two representatives in the tournament, including Harry. Now 
               Harry has to rise to the challenge for the Tri Wizard 
               Tournament while keeping up with school.

               their forest is gone, and they have little to no food left. 
               Their leader Verne, a nervous turtle, suggests they must adapt.
               Newcomer RJ the raccoon gives them another option: go over the 
               hedge and get food from the humans! The other forest animals 
               quickly give in to RJ's blandishments, sneaking into the human 
               world to get all the food they can grab. What they don't know 
               is that RJ is actually in debt to Vincent, a huge, hungry bear.
               RJ has stolen all of Vincent's food, and Vincent has warned RJ 
               that unless it's all back before the full moon, RJ will regret 
               having stolen it, because then RJ takes its place!

NOTE         It's been a long, hot summer in the Moomin Valley. All of the 
               creatures are becoming bored with the unchanging season-until a
               volcanic eruption causes a major flood. As the Moomin family

DESCRIPT     353 pages ; 22 cm.
NOTE         "In the tradition of M.F.K. Fisher, Laurie Colwin, and Ruth 
               Reichl, [this book] is a narrative in which food--eating it, 
               cooking it, reflecting on it--becomes the vehicle for unpacking
               a life. Christensen explores her history of hunger--not just 
               for food but for love and confidence and a sense of belonging--
               with a profound honesty, starting with her unorthodox childhood
               in 1960s Berkeley as the daughter of a mercurial legal activist
               who ruled the house with his fists"--Dust jacket flap.
NOTE         A mouthwatering literary memoir about an unusual upbringing and 
               the long, winding path to happiness. For Christensen, food and 
               eating have always been powerful connectors to self and world. 
               In this passionate feast of a memoir she reflects upon her 
               journey of innocence lost and wisdom gained, mistakes made and 
               lessons learned, and hearts broken and mended. And food-- 
               eating it, cooking it, reflecting on it-- becomes the vehicle 
               for unpacking a life.

               of the last two dairy farms in this area, and recollections of 
               five former dairy farms.  The Johnson family, owners of 
               Rustlewood farm, have recently signed a conservation easement 
               agreement for their 320 acres, permanently protecting their 
               land from development, but the future of the other farmlands 
               along this country road remains unknown.  Through historical 
               and contemporary photographs and video, the film evokes

NOTE         Richard Estes (b. 1932) is one of the most celebrated adopters of
               photorealism; his paintings are characterized by painstaking 
               detail that mimics the clarity and accuracy of photographs. 
               Estes' most famous canvases from the 1970s depict New York's 
               urban landscape, and his manner of painting reflections in a 
               multitude of metal and glass surfaces displays astounding 
               technical skill. In his subsequent career, Estes has continued 
               to demonstrate his superlative ability to show complex plays of
               light and shadow in Maine seascapes, views of Venetian lagoons,
               and night time street scenes. Accompanying Estes' first solo 
               exhibition of paintings in the United States in over two 
               decades, 'Richard Estes' Realism' surveys fifty years of his 
               work and places him within the historical narrative of realist 
               painting. The authors explore the ongoing modernist dialogue 
               between camera and canvas, and discuss the situation of Estes' 
               work at the crossroads of painting and photography. Over fifty 
               full-page plates showcase the amazing precision of Estes' 
               paintings, and a thorough chronology and bibliography provide 
               an enlightening account of his life. This handsome book offers 
               a lavish presentation of Estes' spellbinding body of work that 
               attests to his enduring artistic impact.

NOTE         There is an old belief that everyone is rewarded with the heaven 
               or hell that he deserves. For Phil, the nasty, self-centered 
               weather forecaster in "Groundhog Day," that hell reveals itself
               one morning in the Groundhog Capitol of the USA, Punxsutawney, 
               Pa. He has journeyed there to do a remote broadcast about his 
               namesake, the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil, and wakes up the 
               next morning in the same bed, with the radio playing the same 
               song, and it gradually becomes clear to him that he is reliving
               precisely the same day. It will be Groundhog Day again
               tomorrow, too, and on the day after that. Finally, Phil begins 
               to ponder the question "What would you do if you were stuck in 
               one place, and everything that you did was the same, and 
               nothing mattered?"

NOTE         You can count on Rick Steves to tell you what you "really" need 
               to know when travelling in London. With the self guided tours 
               in this book, you'll explore historic Big Ben, bustling 
               Trafalgar Square, and the Tower of London, home of the crown 
               jewels. Learn how to save time and money on the Tube, and how 
               to avoid the mobs at the Changing of the Guard. Investigate 
               London's world class museums, where you can trace Western 
               civilisation from the Magna Carta and Shakespeare to Van Gogh 
               and Picasso. Venture into Soho's theater district for a glitzy 
               musical or a delicious Indian dinner. End a great day at a 
               neighbourhood pub, sharing a pint and a chat with a friendly 
               local. Rick's candid, humourous advice will guide you to good 
               value hotels and restaurants in delightful London 
               neighbourhoods. You'll learn how to get around by bus and on 
               the Tube, and which sights are worth your time and money. More 
               than just reviews and directions, a Rick Steves guidebook is a 
               tour guide in your pocket.

NOTE         A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great chef despite his 
               family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a 
               decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in 
               Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant 
               made famous by his culinary hero. Despite the apparent dangers 
               of being an unwanted visitor in the kitchen of one of Paris' 
               most exclusive restaurants, Remy forms an unlikely partnership 
               with Linguini, the garbage boy, who inadvertently discovers 
               Remy's amazing talents. They strike a deal, ultimately setting 
               into motion a chain of extraordinary events that turns the 
               culinary world of Paris upside down.

NOTE         From one of the leading thinkers on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
               Therapy, a pioneering set of simple practices to dissolve 
               anxiety, stress, exhaustion, and unhappiness. Everyday life is 
               so frantic and full of troubles that we have largely forgotten 
               how to live a joyful existence. We try so hard to be happy that
               we often end up missing the most important parts of our lives. 
               In Mindfulness, Oxford professor Mark Williams and award-
               winning journalist Danny Penman reveal the secrets to living a 
               happier and less anxious, stressful, and exhausting life. Based
               on the techniques of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, the 
               unique program developed by Williams and his colleagues, the 
               book offers simple and straightforward forms of mindfulness 
               meditation that can be done by anyone--and it can take just 10 
               to 20 minutes a day for the full benefits to be revealed.

NOTE         Romantic triangle set in the world of television news. Tom 
               Grunick is the perfect modern anchorman. He's got the smooth 
               charm and handsome good looks that America loves. Jane Craig is
               the brilliant hot-shot producer, committed to fighting the 
               trend toward flashy, style-over-substance "personality" news, 
               whose job it now is to make Tom look like a newsman. Aaron 
               Altman is the dedicated reporter, utterly devoid of on-camera 
               charisma, who's jealous and resentful of Tom's instant success 
               both on camera with the public and off camera with Jane.

NOTE         "The incomparable Rebecca Solnit, author of more than a dozen 
               acclaimed books of nonfiction, brings the same dazzling writing
               to the twenty-nine essays in The Encyclopedia of Trouble and 
               Spaciousness. As the title suggests, the territory of Solnit's 
               concerns is vast, and in her signature alchemical style she 
               combines commentary on history, justice, war and peace, and 
               explorations of place, art, and community, all while writing 
               with the lyricism of a poet to achieve incandescence and
               wisdom. Gathered here are celebrated iconic essays along with 
               little-known pieces that create a powerful survey of the world 
               we live in. In its encyclopedic reach and its generous 
               compassion, Solnit's collection charts a way through the 
               thickets of our complex social and political worlds. Like the 
               women who've pioneered before her-Sontag, Didion, and Dillard-
               her essays are a beacon. "-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "Born into poverty in southern New Jersey and raised in a commune
               of single mothers, Mary Anna King watched her mother give away 
               one of her newborn sisters every year to another family. All 
               told, there were seven children: Mary, her older brother, and 
               five phantom sisters. Then one day, Mary was sent away, too. 
               Living in Oklahoma with her maternal grandfather, Mary gets a 
               new name and a new life. But she's haunted by the past: by the 
               baby girls she's sure will come looking for her someday, by the
               mother she had to leave behind, by the father who left her. 
               Mary is a college student when her sisters start to get back in
               touch. With each reunion, her family becomes closer to whole 
               again. Moving, haunting, and at times wickedly funny, Bastards 
               is about finding one's family and oneself"--Provided by

TITLE        Chasing the monsoon [compact disc] : a modern pilgrimage through 
               India / by Alexander Frater.

NOTE         This is the story of how one man realized his dream of witnessing
               firsthand the most dramatic of meteorological events: the 
               Indian monsoon. Alexander Frater spent the first six years of 
               his life on a South Pacific island, where his father, the only 
               doctor within a thousand square miles, encouraged his 
               fascination and respect for the volatile play of the elements. 
               Frater brings this heritage to his observations on the monsoon,
               following it from its burst on the beaches of Trivandrum 
               through Delhi and Calcutta, across Bangladesh, to its finale in
               the town of Cherrapunji, the "wettest place on earth." Frater 
               uses fact, impression, and anecdote to vividly describe his own
               experience of the monsoon while also illustrating the towering 
               influence of nature over the lives of Indians.

               heals through the simple pleasures of cooking after the abrupt 
               closing of Gourmet magazine.  Each dish Reichl prepares for 
               herself--and for her family and friends--represents a life's 
               passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl 
               out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that 
               accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a 
               rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring.  Part 
               cookbook, part personal narrative, part paean to the household 
               gods, My Kitchen Year reveals Reichl's most treasured recipes, 
               to be shared over and over again with those we love,"--page [4]

DESCRIPT     307 p. : ill. ; 25 cm.
NOTE         "Set in Provence, London, and New York: a daughter's wonderfully 
               evocative and witty memoir of her mother and stepfather--Dee 
               Wells, the glamorous and rebellious American journalist, and A.
               J. Ayer, the celebrated and worldly Oxford philosopher--and the
               life they lived at the center of absolutely everything. Gully 
               Wells takes us into the heart of London's liberated 
               intellectual inner circle of the 1960s. Here are Alan Bennett, 
               Isaiah Berlin, Iris Murdoch, Bertrand Russell, Jonathan Miller,
               Martin Amis, Christopher Hitchens, Robert Kennedy, and later in
               New York Mayor Lindsay and Mike Tyson . . . her mother as a 
               television commentator earning a reputation for her outspoken 
               style and progressive views . . . her stepfather, an icon in 
               the world of twentieth-century philosophy, proving himself as 
               prodigious a womanizer as he was a thinker. And throughout, 
               there is La Migoua, the house in France, on a hill between 
               Toulon and Marseilles, where her parents and their friends came
               together and where Gully herself learned some of the long-
               lasting lessons of a life well-lived. A dazzling portrait of a 
               woman who 'caught the spirit of the sixties' and one of the 
               most important intellectual figures of the twentieth century, 
               drawn from the vivid memory of the child who adored them
               both."-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "A recipe collection and how-to guide for preparing base 
               ingredients that can be used to make simple, weeknight meals, 
               while also teaching skills like building and cooking over a 
               fire, and preserving meat and produce, written by a sustainable
               food expert and founder of Belcampo Meat Co. Anya Fernald's 
               style of cooking is rustic and simple, shaped by her years 
               working on farms, living in Italy, and running Slow Food
               Nation--but it's also sophisticated and brilliant. Her secret 
               is that by taking the time to create beautiful, super-flavorful
               base ingredients ahead of time--such as homemade sauces, 
               preserves, pickles, and cured meats--you can easily create fast
               but luscious meals later using these components. InHome Cooked,
               Fernald teaches readers her methods and heritage skills to help
               them become more intuitive, natural home cooks who don't need 
               to rely on recipes. Along the way, she shares kitchen tips and 
               tricks for transforming food into something truly special, as 
               well as her food philosophy and inspired approach to home

               his buddies at the Institution of Law Enforcement and Heroics 
               aren't the heroes everyone thinks they are. But as small acts 
               of mischief escalate into a vicious battle, Lord Blackheart 
               realizes that Nimona's powers are as murky and mysterious as 
               her past. And her unpredictable wild side might be more 
               dangerous than he is willing to admit"-- provided by publisher.

ALT TITLE    On homecoming and belonging.
EDITION      First edition.
IMPRINT      New York : Twelve, 2016.
DESCRIPT     xvii, 168 pages ; 20 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (pages 139-168).
NOTE         "Draws on history, psychology, and anthropology to discuss how 
               the tribal connection--the instinct to belong to small groups 
               with a clear purpose and common understanding--can satisfy the 
               human quest for meaning and belonging,"--NoveList.
NOTE         "Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin 
               lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to 
               the Indians--but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal 
               society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on 
               Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in 
               our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent 
               example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to 
               find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of 
               platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of 
               deployment may help explain the high rates of post-traumatic 
               stress disorder suffered by military veterans today. Combining 
               history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we 
               can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and 
               the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony
               that--for many veterans as well as civilians--war feels better 
               than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and 
               disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or
               tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we 
               come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's 
               divided world."--From dust jacket.

               cooking replace school, and marriages begin to be arranged.

NOTE         Profiles the group of Los Angeles studio musicians known as the 
               Wrecking Crew--featuring Tommy Tedesco, guitar, Hal Blaine, 
               Earl Palmer, drums, Carol Kaye, Joe Osborne, bass--who played 
               on many rock and pop hits during the sixties. Gifted,
               versatile, and possessing the knack for turning a simple tune 
               into something memorable, the Wrecking Crew were the players 
               who turned the Wall of Sound in Phil Spector's head into a 
               reality, and helped Brian Wilson create the musical vision that
               would redefine California pop. The Wrecking Crew also backed up
               everyone from Sonny and Cher, the Mamas and the Papas and the 
               Monkees to Herb Alpert, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, but 
               while they became legends in the music business, they were all 
               but unknown to the millions of people who made their records 
               some of the biggest hits of the day. Filmmaker Denny Tedesco--
               whose father Tommy was a member of the Wrecking Crew and 
               perhaps the most recorded guitarist in history--brings the
               free-wheeling story of the most famous musicians you've never 
               heard of to the screen. Bonus disc includes interviews with 
               guitarists, various performing artists, drummers
               /percussionists, producers/arrangers, engineers, bassists, 
               pianists, and saxophonists associated with the Wrecking Crew.

DESCRIPT     247 pages ; 20 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.
NOTE         Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is now hugely popular, and as a 
               self-help technique that has helped millions of people in the 
               UK alone, and as an NHS-funded treatment for illnesses like 
               depression. Teach Yourself: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy was 
               one of the first and most successful books on CBT. This new 
               edition shows how CBT techniques, which focus on using altered 
               patterns of thinking to achieve goals and overcome problems, 
               can make a major difference to your mentality. The first half 
               of the book explains the background to CBT, what it is, and how
               to use it. The second half of the book gives examples of how 
               you can use CBT to deal with specific issues, such as helping 
               to overcome depression and anxiety, and boosting your 
               mindfulness, resilience, assertiveness and self-esteem.

NOTE         "Warren Duffy has returned to America for all the worst reasons: 
               his marriage to a beautiful Welsh woman has come apart; his 
               comic shop in Cardiff has failed; and his Irish-American father
               has died, bequeathing to Warren his last possession, a
               roofless, half-renovated mansion in the heart of black 
               Philadelphia. On his first night in his new home, Warren spies 
               two figures in the grass outside; when he screws up the nerve 
               to confront them, they disappear. The next day he encounters 
               ghosts of a different kind: in the face of the teenage girl he 
               meets at a comics convention he sees the mingled features of 
               his white father and his black mother, both now dead. The girl 
               is his daughter and she thinks she's white. Warren sets off to 
               remake his life with a reluctant daughter he never knew and a 
               haunted house and history he knows too well. In their search 
               for a new life they struggle with an unwanted house and its 
               ghosts, fall in with a utopian mixed-race cult, and inspire a 
               riot on Loving Day, the unsung holiday that celebrates

               Ben Gates' great-great grandfather is suddenly implicated as a 
               key conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The 
               page is one of 18 pages missing from Booth's diary. When doing 
               more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail, and Riley 
               from Buckingham Palace to the White House - both places they 
               break into - and even stealing a page from a secret book. But 
               in order to see more from the book, their choice is either get 
               elected president or kidnap the President of the United States.
               So, Ben kidnaps the president. The conspiracy then crosses to 
               Mount Rushmore. Now, Ben will have to clear his family's name 
               so they will no longer be linked to the assassination.

TITLE        Feminism unfinished : a short, surprising history of American 
               women's movements / Dorothy Sue Cobble, Linda Gordon, and 
               Astrid Henry.
EDITION      First edition.
IMPRINT      New York : Liveright Publishing Corporation, a division of W. W. 
               Norton & Company, [2014]
DESCRIPT     xxi, 265 pages : illustrations ; 25 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references and index.
NOTE         Traces the origins of the feminist movement to the 1920s and 
               follows the post-Suffrage movements, which exposed the 
               exploitation of women in the workplace and fought for sexual 
               rights and freedoms.
NOTE         "In this bold, revisionist history, three leading scholars of 
               women's history provide the first concise history of American 
               women's movements over the nearly hundred years since women 
               gained the right to vote. They eschew the popular--though 
               incomplete--narrative focusing on the 1960s and 1970s, and 
               trace the world-changing social movement to the 1920s. This 
               broader canvas allows for the struggles of all women, including
               working-class women, to come to the foreground. Among the many 
               myths the book dispels is the notion that feminism was a 
               movement of the largely white, highly educated, upper middle 
               class. The authors vividly render the struggles of those women 
               who organized rallies, demonstrations, and sit-ins--often 
               working alongside civil rights demonstrators--to demand equal 
               wages and better jobs, as well as the right to both sexual 
               pleasure and reproductive control. The book also provides a 
               counterpoint to the contemporary corporate-backed "lean-in" 
               philosophy; the authors argue that this assumes that gains for 
               a tiny elite will help all women. They demonstrate that, to the
               contrary, the gains women have made were created by working 
               together for social change rather than by striving individually
               for personal success. While each new generation since 1920 has 
               arrived in a world improved by the efforts of previous 
               struggles, the movement is far from over. Progress is not a 
               birthright but rather a vision that has been constructed, 
               reconstructed, and fought for over and over again." --

NOTE         A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism
               from one of the most-watched young cultural observers of her 
               generation, Roxane Gay"Pink is my favorite color. I used to say
               my favorite color was black to be cool, but it is pink-all 
               shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink. I 
               read Vogue, and I'm not doing it ironically, though it might 
               seem that way. I once live-tweeted the September issue."In 
               these funny and insightful essays, Roxane Gay takes us through 
               the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of 
               color (The Help) while also taking listeners on a ride through 
               culture of the last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and 
               commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris 
               Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an 
               incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand 
               herself and our society but also one of our culture.Bad 
               Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in 
               which the culture we consume becomes who we are and an 
               inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do 
               better.

NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (p. [433]-444) and index.
NOTE         Frances Perkins is no longer a household name, yet she was one of
               the most influential women of the twentieth century. Frances 
               Perkins was named Secretary of Labor by Franklin Roosevelt in 
               1933. As the first female cabinet secretary, at the height of 
               the Great Depression, she spearheaded the fight to improve the 
               lives of America's working people while juggling her own family
               responsibilities. Perkins's ideas became the cornerstones of 
               the most important social welfare legislation in the nation's 
               history, including unemployment compensation, child labor laws,
               the forty-hour work week, and Social Security. Also, as head of
               the Immigration Service, she fought to bring European refugees 
               to safety. Based on eight years of research, extensive archival
               materials, new documents, and exclusive access to family and 
               friends, this is the first complete portrait of a devoted 
               public servant with a passionate personal life, a mother who 
               changed the landscape of American business and society.--From

NOTE         Even Dogs in the Wild brings back Ian Rankin's greatest 
               characters in a novel that explores the darkest corners of our 
               instincts and desires.  Detective Inspector Siobhan Clarke is 
               investigating the death of a senior lawyer that occurred during
               a robbery.  The case becomes more complex when a note is 
               discovered, indicating that this may have been no random
               attack.  When local gangster Big Ger Cafferty receives an 
               identical message, Clarke decides that the recently retired 
               John Rebus may be able to help.  Together the two old 
               adversaries might just stand a chance of saving Cafferty's
               skin.  But a notorious family tailed by a team of undercover 
               detectives has also arrived in Edinburgh.  There's something 
               they want, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.  As the cases
               collide, it's a game of dog eat dog-in the city as in the
               wild.--Publisher's web site.

NOTE         "Over the course of her baking career, Dorie Greenspan has 
               created more than 300 cookie recipes. Yet she has never written
               a book about them--until now. To merit her "three purple stars 
               of approval," every cookie had to be so special that it begged 
               to be made again and again. Cookies for every taste and 
               occasion are here. There are company treats like Portofignos, 
               with chocolate dough and port-soaked figs, and lunch-box 
               Blueberry Buttermilk Pie Bars. They Might Be Breakfast Cookies 
               are packed with goodies--raisins, dried apples, dried 
               cranberries, and oats-- while Almond Crackle Cookies have just

               Christmas cookie swaps, including Little Rascals (German jam 
               sandwich cookies with walnuts), Italian Saucissons (chocolate 
               log cookies studded with dried fruit), and Snowy-Topped Brownie
               Drops. And who but America's favorite baker could devise a 
               cookie as intriguing as Pink-Peppercorn Thumbprints or as 
               popular as the World Peace Cookie, with its 59 million Internet
               fans?,"--Amazon.com.
NOTE         Over the course of her baking career Greenspan has created more 
               than 300 cookie recipes. To merit her approval, every cookie 
               had to be so special that it begged to be made again and again.
               Here she includes dozens of choices for cookie swaps, shows you
               how to make cookies unlike any you've seen before and presents 
               those that bring out the inner tinkerer in all of us. In other 
               words, the recipes she loves to share with her family and

NOTE         Roddy is a decidedly upper-crust "society mouse" who lives the

               rat named Sid comes out of the sink, he desides he had hit the 
               jackpot. Roddy schemes to rid himself of Sid by luring him into
               the "whirlpool." Sid may be an ignorant slob, but he's no fool,
               but it is Roddy who winds up being flushed away into the 
               bustling sewer world of Ratropolis. There Roddy meets Rita, an 
               enterprising scavenger who works the sewers in the Jammy
               Dodger, her faithful boat. Roddy immediately wants out, or 
               rather, up. Trouble comes in the form of the villainous Toad --
               who royally despises all rodents. The Toad dispatches his two 
               hapless hench-rats, Spike and Whitey, to get the job done. When
               they fail, the Toad has no choice but to send to France for his
               cousin, Le Frog, the dreaded mercenary.

NOTE         Margaret Wise Brown's books have sold millions of copies all over
               the world, but few people know that she was at the center of a 
               children's book publishing revolution. Her whimsy and 
               imagination fueled a steady stream of stories, songs, and
               poems, and she was renowned for her prolific writing and 
               business savvy, as well as her beauty and endless thirst for 
               adventure. Margaret started her writing career by helping to 
               shape the curriculum for the Bank Street School for Children, 
               making it her mission to create stories that would rise above 
               traditional fairy tales and allowed girls to see themselves as 
               equals to boys. At the same time, she also experimented 
               endlessly with her own writing. Margaret embraced life with 
               passion, lived extravagantly off of her royalties, went on 
               rabbit hunts, and carried on long and troubled love affairs 
               with both men and women. One of great loves in Margaret's life 
               was a gender-bending poet and ex-wife of John Barrymore who 
               went by the stage name of Michael Strange. She and Margaret had
               a tempestuous yet secret relationship, at one point living next
               door to each other. After the dissolution of their relationship
               and Michael's death, Margaret became engaged to a younger man 
               who also happened to be the son of a Rockefeller and a
               Carnegie. But before they could marry Margaret died 
               unexpectedly at the age of forty-two, leaving behind a cache of
               unpublished work and a timeless collection of books that would 
               go on to become classics in children's literature.

               25 cm.
NOTE         "The life story of Coretta Scott King--wife of Martin Luther King
               Jr., founder of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, 
               and singular twentieth-century American civil rights activist--
               as told fully for the first time, toward the end of her life, 
               to one of her closest friends. Born in 1927 to daringly 
               enterprising black parents in the Deep South, Coretta Scott had
               always felt called to a special purpose. One of the first black
               scholarship students recruited to Antioch College, a committed 
               pacifist, and a civil rights activist, she was an avowed 
               feminist--a graduate student determined to pursue her own 
               career--when she met Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister
               insistent that his wife stay home with the children. But in 
               love and devoted to shared Christian beliefs and racial justice
               goals, she married King, and events promptly thrust her into a 
               maelstrom of history throughout which she was a strategic 
               partner, a standard bearer, a marcher, a negotiator, and a 
               crucial fundraiser in support of world-changing achievements. 
               As a widow and single mother of four, while butting heads with 
               the all-male African American leadership of the times, she 
               championed gay rights and AIDS awareness, founded the King 
               Center for Nonviolent Social Change, lobbied for fifteen years 
               to help pass a bill establishing the US national holiday in 
               honor of her slain husband, and was a powerful international 
               presence, serving as a UN ambassador and playing a key role in 
               Nelson Mandela's election. Coretta's is a love story, a family 
               saga, and the memoir of an independent-minded black woman in 
               twentieth-century America, a brave leader who stood committed, 
               proud, forgiving, nonviolent, and hopeful in the face of 
               terrorism and violent hatred every single day of her life."--

AUTHOR       McKibben, Bill.
TITLE        Deep economy : the wealth of communities and the durable future /
               Bill McKibben.
EDITION      1st ed.
IMPRINT      New York : Times Books, 2007.
DESCRIPT     261 p. ; 25 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references 25 and index.
NOTE         An impassioned call for an economy that creates community and 
               ennobles our lives. In this manifesto, journalist McKibben 
               offers the biggest challenge in a generation to the prevailing 
               view of our economy. For the first time in human history, he 
               observes, "more" is no longer synonymous with "better"--indeed,
               they have become almost opposites. McKibben puts forward a new 
               way to think about the things we buy, the food we eat, the 
               energy we use, and the money that pays for it all. Our 
               purchases, he says, need not be at odds with the things we 
               truly value. McKibben's animating idea is that we need to move 
               beyond "growth" as the paramount economic ideal and pursue 
               prosperity in a more local direction, with regions producing 
               more of their own food, generating more of their own energy, 
               and even creating more of their own culture and
               entertainment.--From publisher description.
NOTE         After growth  --  The year of eating locally  --  All for one, or

AUTHOR       Smick, David M., author.
TITLE        The great equalizer : how main street capitalism can create an 
               economy for everyone / David M. Smick.
EDITION      First Edition.
IMPRINT      New York : PublicAffairs, [2017]
DESCRIPT     xxii, 232 pages ; 25 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (pages 205-215) and index.
NOTE         "The experts say that America's best days are behind us, that 
               mediocre long-term economic growth is baked in the cake, and 
               that politically, socially, and racially, the United States 
               will continue to tear itself apart. But David Smick--hedge fund
               strategist and author of the 2008 bestseller The World Is 
               Curved--argues that the experts are wrong. In recent decades, a
               Corporate Capitalism of top down mismanagement and backroom 
               deal-making has smothered America's innovative spirit. Policy 
               now favors the big, the corporate, and the status quo at the 
               expense of the small, the inventive, and the entrepreneurial. 
               The result is that working and middle class Americans have seen
               their incomes flat-lining and their American Dreams slipping 
               away. In response, Smick calls for the great equalizer, a Main 
               Street Capitalism of mass small-business startups and bottom-up
               innovation, all unfolding on a level playing field. Introducing
               a fourteen-point plan of bipartisan reforms for unleashing 
               America's creativity and confidence, his forward-thinking book 
               describes a new climate of dynamism where every man and woman 
               is a potential entrepreneur--especially those at the bottom 
               rungs of the economic ladder. Ultimately, Smick argues, 
               economies are more than statistical measurements of supply and 
               demand, economic output, and rates of return. Economies are 
               people--their hopes, fears, dreams, and expectations. The Great
               Equalizer is a call for a set of new paradigms that inspire and
               empower average American people to reimagine and reboot their 
               economy. It is a manifesto asserting that, with a new kind of 
               economic policy, America's best days lie ahead"-- Provided by 
               publisher.
NOTE         Growth is (almost) everything -- The illusion of certainty -- The
               economy's turbocharger -- Top-down frustration in a bottom-up 
               world -- The world's greatest wager -- It's nobody's century 
               (or maybe everybody's) -- Americans are fighters -- A nation of

TITLE        The rules do not apply : a memoir / Ariel Levy.
EDITION      First edition.
IMPRINT      New York : Random House, [2017]
DESCRIPT     xi, 207 pages ; 22 cm.
NOTE         "A gorgeous, darkly humorous memoir for readers of Cheryl Strayed
               about a woman overcoming dramatic loss and finding reinvention,
               as well as a portrait of a generation used to assuming they're 
               entitled to everything--based on this award-winning writer's 
               New Yorker article 'Thanksgiving in Mongolia'"-- Provided by 
               publisher.
NOTE         "In 2012, at age 38, when she left on a reporting trip to 
               Mongolia, Ariel Levy thought she had figured it out: she was 
               married, pregnant, successful on her own terms, financially 
               secure. A month later, none of that was true. 'People have been
               telling me since I was a little girl that I was too fervent, 
               too forceful, too much. I thought I had harnessed the power of 
               my own strength and greed and love to a life that could contain
               it. But it has exploded.' In gorgeous, moving, humorous, sharp,
               and unforgettable prose, with pointillist portraits of a girl 
               and then a young woman coming of age, Levy describes her own 
               ill-fated assumptions: thinking that anything is possible, that
               the old rules do not apply; that marriage doesn't have to mean 
               monogamy; that gender and sexuality are fluid; that aging
               doesn't have to mean infertility. This is a searing story, 
               written with humor, brilliance, and insight, that is at once 
               personal and universal--a story about realizing that life is so
               often beyond our control, and how we forge ahead despite that. 
               In telling her own story, Levy has captured a portrait of our 
               time, of the shifting forces in values, women and gender in 
               American culture, of what has changed and what has remained"--

TITLE        Tales in design : an engineer's journey into the complex nature 
               of design / Jud Pitman.

NOTE         Includes bibliographical references.
NOTE         Car buffs and designers of every discipline will find much to 
               enjoy here. What drives the desire to design? Tales in Design 
               is about the nature of creativity and the design process--and 
               more. Each chapter provides a personal vignette marrying a 
               design challenge/solution with mentors and/or family, while 
               taking a nontraditional approach. The author is a mechanical 
               engineer, able to re-visualize form, contour, and structure 
               through different lenses. If you've shaved, gone running, 
               driven at night, or had blood drawn, it's likely you have 
               benefitted from the results of Jud Pitman's patented design 
               work. These are some of his tales.

NOTE         Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin 
               lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to 
               the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal 
               society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on 
               Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in 
               our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent 
               example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to 
               find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of 
               platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of 
               deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress 
               disorder suffered by military veterans today.

NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (p. [289]-293) and index.
NOTE         Introducing the ecological garden -- A gardener's ecology --

               garden guilds -- Growing a food forest -- Permaculture 
               gardening in the city -- Pop goes the garden.
NOTE         The first edition of Gaia's Garden sparked the imagination of 
               America's home gardeners, introducing permaculture's central 
               message: Working with Nature, not against her, results in more 
               beautiful, abundant, and forgiving gardens. This extensively 
               revised and expanded second edition broadens the reach and 
               depth of the permaculture approach for urban and suburban 
               growers. Many people mistakenly think that ecological gardening
               - which involves growing a wide range of edible and other 
               useful plants - can take place only on a large, multiacre
               scale. As Hemenway demonstrates, it's fun and easy to create
               a 'backyard ecosystem' by assembling communities of plants that
               can work cooperatively and perform a variety of functions, 
               including: Building and maintaining soil fertility and 
               structure Catching and conserving water in the landscape 
               Providing habitat for beneficial insects, birds, and animals 
               Growing an edible 'forest' that yields seasonal fruits, nuts, 
               and other foods This revised and updated edition also features 
               a new chapter on urban permaculture, designed especially for 
               people in cities and suburbs who have very limited growing 
               space. Whatever size yard or garden you have to work with, you 
               can apply basic permaculture principles to make it more
               diverse, more natural, more productive, and more beautiful. 
               Best of all, once it's established, an ecological garden will 
               reduce or eliminate most of the backbreaking work that's needed
               to maintain the typical lawn and garden.

TITLE        Becoming Portsmouth : voices from a half century of change / 
               Laura Pope, editor; foreword by Denise J. Wheeler.
IMPRINT      Charleston, S.C. : The History Press, 2017.
DESCRIPT     142 p., :  ill. ;  23 cm.
NOTE         "At midcentury, two federal urban renewal projects in the gritty,
               blue-collar navy town of Portsmouth decimated two
               neighborhoods. But in the 1970s and '80s--thanks to an influx 
               of artisans, chefs and entrepreneurs--the Port City emerged as 
               a beacon of arts, culinary excellence and preservation. 
               Iconoclast Jay Smith opened the Press Room, the celebrated 
               music club. A group of concerned citizens saved the Music Hall,
               the last of Portsmouth's vaudeville theaters. And a Dutch 
               family opened the Euro-style Café Petronella next to a biker 
               bar. Author and historian Laura Pope edits a collection of 
               essays detailing the changes in the last half of the past 
               century that made Portsmouth a lauded arts- and food-lovers' 
               hub and, finally, a diverse tourist destination." From the back
